## What is actually running

### AWS

- EC2 `aitx-agent-host` is the always-on compute plane.
- Containers seen live: OpenShell workspace, healthy OpenClaw sandbox,
  `autoresearch`, and `search-cache`.
- `autoresearch` uses `restart=unless-stopped`.
- Host cron runs `scripts/nightly_master_cycle.py` at `05:30 UTC`.
- AutoResearch had 41 snapshots when checked. The current champion was 0.5933
  decision accuracy, 100% deal safety.
- Both security-group and NACL rules for SSH and the read-only leaderboard are
  active. `http://35.172.137.131:8787/` and `/radar` returned 200 publicly.
- AWS SSO is authenticated. The instance was relaunched at 04:11 UTC, which
  explains the stale prior IP and SSH failure.
- The merged Hermes workspace requires Git. The old bare-Python container
  failed once after the code update; Compose now installs Git and owns the
  durable `autoresearch` service. It restarted cleanly with zero restarts.

### Railway

- Active coordinator:
  `https://nemoclaw-coordinator-api-production.up.railway.app`
- Live results at audit time: 41 radar rows, three evaluation rows, four episodic
  rows.
- The coordinator reports `idle` because `/api/status` describes its legacy
  in-process demo runner. The real AutoResearch worker runs on EC2. `/api/radar`
  is the authoritative liveness signal.
- The Railway CLI account can see two older `cursor-claude-connector` projects,
  but neither owns the active coordinator hostname. The active service is
  probably under a teammate's Railway project. It is reachable but not
  manageable from this login.
- Railway storage is ephemeral. A test episode POST returned 200, then a later
  read returned the original four rows. EC2 now replace-syncs durable radar
  history, while Supabase is authoritative for episodes and daily runs.

### Supabase

Live counts when audited:

| Table | Rows |
|---|---:|
| `listings` | 15 |
| `sources` | 6 |
| `sync_runs` | 6 |
| `rsi_runs` | 1 |
| `episodes` | 15 after integration test |
| `search_cache` | 1 |

The initial zero episode count exposed the missing Discord persistence path.
The end-to-end test then wrote 15 real Discord episodes: one approved and 14
neutral. No local migration was used.

### Vercel and UI

- Public deployment: `https://decision-frontier.vercel.app`
- Marketplace cards use hosted Supabase. The GPU endpoint returned three live
  Best Buy rows.
- The merged Cursor leaderboard adds Karpathy-style keep/discard charts.
- The API now prefers Railway's live radar history and falls back to committed
  evidence only when the coordinator is unavailable.
- Playwright verified both Leaderboard and Methodology with live data, autoplay,
  zoom/fullscreen controls, and no application JavaScript errors. The new
  21.5-second recording is `dashboard/media/rsi-05-autoresearch-progress.mp4`.
- `/api/radar`, `/api/autoresearch-status`, `/api/evaluations`, and
  `/api/episodic-memory` are read-only Vercel proxies to Railway.

### Discord

- Brain, Scout, Inspector, and Concierge all authenticate successfully.
- `#daily` contains current GPU research from the agents.
- No webhook is required. Bot-token REST calls already cover:
  - reading human prompts, agent replies, and reactions;
  - posting AutoResearch promotions/checkpoints;
  - posting daily tournament results and weekly review requests.
- A webhook is only useful if an external system must post without a bot token.
- The audit posted a real measured checkpoint to `#daily` at 04:17 UTC:
  accuracy 0.5933, retrieval 2.82s, safety 100%.

## Seven-step AutoResearch loop

1. **Pull Digest** — the 05:30 UTC cron reads live `MEMORY.md`, sandbox episodes,
   and recent Discord conversations.
2. **Recall Ideas** — yesterday's champion plus durable prior results supply the
   starting policies.
3. **Generate Routes** — evaluate control, episodic memory, exemplar-SFT, and
   the current AutoResearch champion.
4. **Verify Candidates** — the frozen golden set measures accuracy, retrieval
   time, price/deal safety, and agent regression.
5. **Select Strategy** — the Pareto gate rejects unsafe, slow, degraded, or
   under-sampled candidates.
6. **Promote Daily** — the winner becomes the live sandbox `MEMORY.md`; metrics
   go to Railway, Supabase, the UI, and Discord.
7. **Weekly Feedback** — Sunday synthesis asks the human for approval or
   corrections; that feedback becomes the next digest.
